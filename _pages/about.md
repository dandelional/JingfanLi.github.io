I am an undergraduate student in Software Engineering at Nankai University, expected to graduate in 2026. My research interests lie primarily in Machine Learning, Multimodal Learning, and Large Language Models ($\text{LLM}$s).



I am passionate about designing and implementing efficient AI systems, gaining hands-on experience with LLM fine-tuning and inference optimization during my internship at Chinasoft International. Currently, I focus on the interplay between Generative Models (Diffusion, $\text{GAN}$s) and controllability/multimodal alignment. My background also includes strong fundamentals in system-level programming and optimization, demonstrated by my coursework in Operating Systems (98) and Compiler Principles (99).

I am an undergraduate student in Software Engineering at Nankai University, expected to graduate in 2026. My primary research interests lie in Machine Learning, Multimodal Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs).

I have strong research skills and engineering expertise, including hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks implementation, experimental design, and system-level programming. In the future, I aim to focus on developing efficient and reliable AI systems at the intersection of multimodal representation learning and large model optimization/deployment, addressing key challenges in real-world application scenarios.

> I am actively looking for **PhD opportunities** starting in **Fall 2026**.
